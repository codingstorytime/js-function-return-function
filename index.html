<h1>A function can return a function.</h1>
<p>

Do you know closure, partial application and currying in JavaScript?
</p>
<p>
An example of a real "partial application concept" is the JavaScript Bind() function
</p>
<p>
Function.prototype.bind()
</p>

<p>
Write a function called <strong>quadrupleWithBind()</strong> to quadruple a number
</p>
<p><strong>For example:</strong> The quadruple of 3 is 12</p>
<p>
3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 * 4 = 12
</p>
<p>
<strong>REQUIRED:</strong> Make sure to use the JavaScript bind() method
</p>
